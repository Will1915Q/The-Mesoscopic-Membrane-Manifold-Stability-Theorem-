The next-generation aircraft engines must achieve high safety, a high thrust-to-weight ratio, excellent acceleration performance, and low fuel consumption. They must also fully leverage their performance capabilities within the constraints of safety and reliability to effectively complete a range of tasks. Consequently, ensuring aerodynamic stability is a critical challenge in the development of high-performance engines. Surge, resulting from aerodynamic instability, can pose significant safety risks. The objective of active surge control is to prevent surge occurrence through accurate prediction and active management of surge and stall, while simultaneously optimizing engine performance. Effective prediction and control of surge/stall in aircraft engine compressors are essential for enhancing engine stability and safety. This paper investigates the technical requirements and challenges associated with active surge control as follows:
1. Research on Compressor Stall Prediction Based on Deep Learning: Compressor stall prediction is fundamental to active surge control. This study addresses challenges such as the detection of subtle precursor signals before surge in multi-stage axial compressors, limited stall warning information, and the shortcomings of traditional prediction methods. This research employs an advanced causal convolution deep learning model for surge stall prediction. By analyzing subtle features in extensive stall data, the deep learning model can accurately identify minute precursor signals, thus enabling precise stall prediction for multi-stage axial compressors. The model also excels in processing imperfect data, where sensors may not fully capture precursor signals. It can discern data trends, periodic patterns, and advanced features that are not immediately observable, calculating and providing stall probabilities. Validation of the deep learning-based stall prediction model was performed offline and online using multi-stage axial compressor test data and a comprehensive experimental platform. Results demonstrate that the proposed method offers advantages in recognizing subtle features, cross-model stall prediction, and handling imperfect data.
2. Research on Active Surge Control Based on the Moore-Greitzer Compressor Dynamics Model: Active surge control must overcome significant challenges related to ensuring fixed-time stability of the closed-loop control system amidst model uncertainties. Surge control technology for aircraft engines often deals with model uncertainty and disturbances, requiring rapid stabilization. This paper proposes a fixed-time active surge control method to improve the controller's adaptability to model variations. Initially, a radial basis function neural network is used to model the nonlinear complex system dynamics considering model uncertainty impacts on control performance. An adaptive law is then introduced to optimize the neural network's weights. A fixed-time controller is designed to stabilize compressor dynamics by adjusting the intake airflow, with fixed-time stability ensuring reduced operational time during surge events. The proposed method's effectiveness was validated through hardware-in-the-loop experiments.
3. Conceptual Research on Mesoscopic Membrane Stability Theory for micro-meso-macro multiscale dynamical system Multiscale Dynamic Systems: This paper extends stability analysis to chaotic and fractal phenomena in turbulence, combustion, and axial compressors, addressing the limitations of Lyapunov stability theory for these systems. It introduces the concept of multiscale dynamical systems and examines Lyapunov stability theory's limitations in such contexts. The paper hypothesizes that chaotic and fractal instabilities result from the transfer of microscopic disorder to macroscopic scales, with mesoscopic force fields and energies playing a crucial role. This theoretical framework addresses the shortcomings of Lyapunov stability theory in analyzing multiscale dynamical systems, providing new methods for stability analysis of complex mesoscopic systems and offering fresh perspectives on surge control.
4. Application of Mesoscopic Membrane Stability Theory in Active Surge Control: Based on the multiscale dynamical systems concept presented in Chapter 4, multi-stage axial compressors exhibit characteristics typical of such systems. This chapter explores the application of mesoscopic membrane stability theory to turbulence simulation and active surge control. It includes the development of a stability model for axial compressor flow based on this theory, proposes a field control concept, and outlines future research directions.
